I have used examples from this same repository for my previous assignment and this assignment:
https://github.com/josdirksen/essential-threejs

However, I have modified it to meet the requirements of this class. The update this week is and added
audio with the animation. Audio was not part of the features listed to implement but I think it's pretty
cool.
