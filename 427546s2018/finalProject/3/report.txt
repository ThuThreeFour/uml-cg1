I have used examples from this same repository for my previous assignment and this assignment:
https://github.com/josdirksen/essential-threejs

However, I have modified it to meet the requirements of this class. The update this week is
7. Create texture/bump/environmental mappings for the object.
Using the application, you can choose 2 textures to add on the object. Zoom in to view the texture in more detail.
You will also noticed half a sphere, which is my interpretation of the bump. The bump will rotate with the main object.
I was unable to implement the environmental mapping because I ran out of time.
