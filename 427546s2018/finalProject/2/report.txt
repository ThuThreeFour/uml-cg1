I have used examples from this same repository for my previous assignment and this assignment:
https://github.com/josdirksen/essential-threejs

However, I have modified it to meet the requirements of this class. The update this week is the user is able to adjust the
size of the model that they are interested in using. For example, if they want to use a cube, then they have the choice
of providing the width, height, and depth of the cube. The other feature I was able to implement was "3. Viewing: view
your created object from multiple views." The user is able to adjust the parameters for the orthographic projections as
follows (https://threejs.org/docs/#api/cameras/OrthographicCamera):
"Left — Camera left plane;
Right — Camera right plane;
Top — Camera top plane;
Bottom — Camera bottom plane;
Near — Camera near plane;
Far — Camera far plane."
In orthographic projections, all objects have the same size regardless of their distance to the camera. This type of
viewing can be used to create 3D scenes.
